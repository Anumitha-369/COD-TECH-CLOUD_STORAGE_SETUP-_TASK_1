Detailed Explanation of Each Step

STEP 1 : Signing in to the AWS Management Console First, you need to access the AWS Management Console by signing in with your AWS credentials. This is your gateway to managing all your AWS services, including S3.
Navigating to the S3 Service Once you're signed in, look for the search bar at the top of the AWS Management Console. Type "S3" into the search bar and select the S3 service from the list of results. This will take you to the S3 dashboard, where you can manage your storage.

STEP 2 : Creating a New S3 Bucket To create a new storage space
click on the "Create bucket" button. You will be prompted to enter a unique name for your bucket. Make sure the name is globally unique to avoid conflicts. For example, you can name it "COD-TECH-CLOUD_STORAGE_SETUP_TASK_1".
Next, select the region where you want your bucket to be hosted. 
In this case, I had choosen the "Asia Pacific (Mumbai)" region. After selecting the region, click on "Create bucket" at the bottom of the page to finalize the creation of your bucket.

STEP 4 : Uploading Files and Folders After creating your bucket, click on the bucket name to open it. This will take you to the bucket's contents page. To upload files and folders, click on the "Upload" button. 
You can either drag and drop files into the upload area or click "Add files" to browse and select files from your computer. Once you have selected the files you want to upload, click on "Upload" to start the upload process.

STEP 5 : Configuring Permissions Configuring permissions is essential to control who can access your bucket and its contents. Go to the "Permissions" tab within the bucket settings. 
Here, you can set a bucket policy to define access permissions. You can choose to make your bucket public or keep it private for personal use based on the data you upload .

Here are some things to be noted and can be enabled based on while creating a bucket :

1 . Creating Tags for Bucket Organization
2 . Enabling Versioning for Object Protection
3 . Setting Up Lifecycle Rules for Data Management
4 . Configuring Server Access Logging for Monitoring
5 . Implementing Bucket Replication for Data Redundancy
6 . Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for Secure Access
7 . Encrypting Data for Enhanced Security [ SSE - SERVER SIDED ENCRYPTION ]
8 . Managing Storage Classes for Cost Optimization
These are some important key terms that I have learnt new as well as worked on it .
